The original framework for this extension was taken from "Open _new & _blank
in new background tab" by Ionut Bilica

The icon is originally from Webweaver, http://www.webweaver.nu/clipart/

The script uses vanilla JavaScript with native MutationObserver for DOM monitoring
and URI.js for URL parsing in the background script.

Performance optimizations include:
- Removed jQuery dependency (reduced bundle size by ~85KB)
- Implemented caching for storage API calls and regex compilation
- Optimized DOM queries and mutation observation
- Added throttling for mutation callbacks to improve performance
